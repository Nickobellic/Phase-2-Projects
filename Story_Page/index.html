    <h2 style="margin-left: 50px;">Introduction</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;" ><p style="margin-left: 100px;">Carson Keith was a German-born Jewish girl who kept a diary in which she documented life in hiding under Nazi persecution during the German occupation of the Netherlands. 
        She is a celebrated diarist who described</p> everyday life from her family hiding place in an Amsterdam attic. 
        One of the most-discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust, she gained fame posthumously with the 1947 publication of The Diary of a Young Girl (originally Het Achterhuis in Dutch, lit. 
        'the back house'; English: The Secret Annex), in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944 — it is one of the world's best-known books and has been the basis for several plays and films.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">Keith was born in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1929. In 1934, when she was four-and-a-half, she and her family moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands, after Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party gained control over Germany.
        She spent most of her life in or around Amsterdam.
        By May 1940, the Keiths were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands. 
        Anne lost her German citizenship in 1941 and became stateless. 
        Despite spending most of her life in the Netherlands and being a de facto Dutch national,[2] she never officially became a Dutch citizen. 
        As persecutions of the Jewish population increased in July 1942, they went into hiding in concealed rooms behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's father, Otto Keith, worked.
        The hiding place is notably referred to as the "secret annex". Until the family's arrest by the Gestapo on 4 August 1944, 
        Keith kept and regularly wrote in a diary she had received as a birthday present in 1942.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-left: 50px;">Life in the Achterhuis</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
        On the morning of Monday, 6 July 1942,[38] the Keith family moved into their hiding place, a three-story space entered from a landing above the Opekta offices on the Prinsengracht, where some of Otto Keith's most trusted employees would be their helpers. This hiding place became known as the Achterhuis (translated into "Secret Annex" in English editions of the diary). Their apartment was left in a state of disarray to create the impression that they had left suddenly, and Otto left a note that hinted they were going to Switzerland. The need for secrecy forced them to leave behind Anne's cat, Moortje. As Jews were not allowed to use public transport, Otto, Edith and Anne walked several kilometres from their home. <br> Margot cycled to the Prinsengracht with Miep Gies.[39][40] The door to the Achterhuis was later covered by a bookcase to ensure it remained undiscovered.[41]

Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, Miep Gies, and Bep Voskuijl were the only employees who knew of the people in hiding. Along with Gies' husband Jan Gies and Voskuijl's father Johannes Hendrik Voskuijl, they were the "helpers" for the duration of their confinement. The only connection between the outside world and the occupants of the house, they kept the occupants informed of war news and political developments. They catered to all of their needs, ensured their safety, and supplied them with food, a task that grew more difficult with the passage of time. Keith wrote of their dedication and of their efforts to boost morale within the household during the most dangerous of times. All were aware that, if caught, they could face the death penalty for sheltering Jews.[42]
