    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson Keith was a German-born Jewish girl who kept a diary in which she documented life in hiding under Nazi persecution during the German occupation of the Netherlands. 
        She is a celebrated diarist who described everyday life from her family hiding place in an Amsterdam attic. 
        One of the most-discussed Jewish victims of the Holocaust, she gained fame posthumously with the 1947 publication of The Diary of a Young Girl (originally Het Achterhuis in Dutch, lit. 
        'the back house'; English: The Secret Annex), in which she documents her life in hiding from 1942 to 1944 — it is one of the world's best-known books and has been the basis for several plays and films.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keith was born in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1929. In 1934, when she was four-and-a-half, she and her family moved to Amsterdam, Netherlands, after Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party gained control over Germany.
        She spent most of her life in or around Amsterdam.
        By May 1940, the Keiths were trapped in Amsterdam by the German occupation of the Netherlands. 
        Anne lost her German citizenship in 1941 and became stateless. 
        Despite spending most of her life in the Netherlands and being a de facto Dutch national,[2] she never officially became a Dutch citizen. 
        As persecutions of the Jewish population increased in July 1942, they went into hiding in concealed rooms behind a bookcase in the building where Anne's father, Otto Keith, worked.
        The hiding place is notably referred to as the "secret annex". Until the family's arrest by the Gestapo on 4 August 1944, 
        Keith kept and regularly wrote in a diary she had received as a birthday present in 1942.</p>

    <h2>Life in the Achterhuis</h2>

        On the morning of Monday, 6 July 1942,[38] the Keith family moved into their hiding place, a three-story space entered from a landing above the Opekta offices on the Prinsengracht, where some of Otto Keith's most trusted employees would be their helpers. This hiding place became known as the Achterhuis (translated into "Secret Annex" in English editions of the diary). Their apartment was left in a state of disarray to create the impression that they had left suddenly, and Otto left a note that hinted they were going to Switzerland. The need for secrecy forced them to leave behind Anne's cat, Moortje. As Jews were not allowed to use public transport, Otto, Edith and Anne walked several kilometres from their home. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margot cycled to the Prinsengracht with Miep Gies.[39][40] The door to the Achterhuis was later covered by a bookcase to ensure it remained undiscovered.[41]

Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, Miep Gies, and Bep Voskuijl were the only employees who knew of the people in hiding. Along with Gies' husband Jan Gies and Voskuijl's father Johannes Hendrik Voskuijl, they were the "helpers" for the duration of their confinement. The only connection between the outside world and the occupants of the house, they kept the occupants informed of war news and political developments. They catered to all of their needs, ensured their safety, and supplied them with food, a task that grew more difficult with the passage of time. Keith wrote of their dedication and of their efforts to boost morale within the household during the most dangerous of times. All were aware that, if caught, they could face the death penalty for sheltering Jews.[42]

    <h2>Rise of Villain</h2>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Carson shared about the experience about her encounter and rise of her enemy.
        There’s never one point where something ‘clicks’. Some like to believe there is, that hobbies or skills reach a well-defined turning point, an ON-OFF switch. It’s never that simple. Even the most abrupt of changes occur over time, not in discrete, quantum moments. That’s why the worst changes are still able to creep up on us, stalking us, strengthening their grasp – and when we finally realise, it’s already too late.
        As quickly as Keith transitioned from a living, breathing person to a dribbling slab of mangled flesh and bone, the same rule applies. It happened over the course of, what, seven, eight seconds – to me, it felt like lifetimes until that moment.
    </p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        It was the third day of our honeymoon in Grenada when it happened. Our boat hovered around the edge of the bay, and at the time I couldn’t have wished for any greater bliss – until that bliss, too, changed. Ripped away like stitches from a fresh wound. Maybe if I’d gotten bored of my book sooner, put it down and looked across the still waters, I’d have seen it coming – but it’s always so easy to think ‘what if?’ isn’t it?
    </p>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        The rogue fishing vessel’s bow crunching through decking boards. Orcy wheeling around, the sunshades slipping past her dark bangs and bouncing off the railing. I heard every intricacy in every sound, every minor crack of wood, pinging screws, every last shrill tone in the fraction of a second she had to scream. Until, eventually, the world settled, clearing its fog and presenting me with a bitter end to something that should’ve lasted forever.
        I don’t like to think about it, really. Perhaps putting it into words will ease some weight, but I doubt it. I still see her whenever I close my eyes. A faceless corpse with nothing but a shattered lower jaw for a head. Her left arm with a big chunk of her shoulder bobbing in the blue and emerald, I can remember every detail if I want to. But I don’t.
        Mercifully, the years have sapped clarity from those memories. They almost feel like a dream now, hazy and desaturated. I’ll never truly forget, though. When it happened, a board buckled and hit me upside my head, fracturing my skull and deafening me in one ear. Once the healing process was over, I got a hearing aid fitted. Whether it’s hearing through that, or being deaf, it’s my constant reminder of how I lost Orcy Keith.

        It was around the trail’s three-quarter marker where I stashed my bike off-track and made my way through the woods. Again, I can’t say why or how I knew something was in there, but whatever it was, I felt intrigued. Enough to distract me from my own thoughts as dry leaves crunched under my heels.
        I found it after only ten minutes. At first I thought it was a clearing, a simple break in the canopy – there was more, however. Taking up the majority of the clearing was a still, murky pond, complete with a dilapidated wooden jetty. The deck made a right turn at the end that led into a hut of some kind, sharing the same moss-crusted poles.
        Cautiously, I planted a foot onto the jetty, and froze. A rush of memories threatened to break free from an old, struggling dam. I took a second to breathe – deep inhale, slow exhale – and my nose picked up on something as I did. Faint as it was, there was the unmistakable smell of something ashy and burnt.

        She experienced some sort of Nightmare during her encounter with an Evil spirit. That traumatized Carson Keith. She took almost a month to mentally recover from that.
